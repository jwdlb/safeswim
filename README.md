- **Customisability**: Allows for any **valid????** network architecture, depending on the users requirements.
- **Provides both Classification and Regression**: Will be able to both classify results into discrete categories, or place results onto a continuous scale.
- **Goose Optimiser**: Features a new form of optimsier, better suited to tackling complex data.

## Running the Application

To execute the simulation execution file, download the Wind Tunnel simulation zip file from the latest release [releases section](https://github.com/jwdlb/WindTunnelSimulation/releases).
Then unZip in the desired foler, and double click on the executable to run.

## Impovements
Further improvements to be made include:
